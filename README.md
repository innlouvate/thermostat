# Makers Academy week 5: thermostat

Setup
--------
This project was completed using TDD and pairing. The daily changing pair programming nature of Maker's means that the project code base can change on a daily basis. Therefore, there are seperate (often ophan) branches for each session and these have not been merged due to differences in approach. 

## Challenges
* business logic
* interface
* jQuery
* APIs
* styling
* saving state

## Challenge setup

Specification:
Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
You can increase the temperature with the up button
You can decrease the temperature with the down button
The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
Power saving mode is on by default
You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button
The thermostat should colour the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red
